# macOS download and distribution

Talent Signal is a relationship workspace for client work, partnerships,
collaboration, and recruiting. The downloadable client is `apps/macos`.
`apps/macos-hybrid` remains a separate experimental capability shell.

## Install on another Mac

1. Open [macOS releases](https://github.com/getyak/talent-signal/releases?q=macos-)
   and select a macOS release. Download its Universal `.dmg` (Apple silicon and
   Intel, macOS 14 or later). Preview releases are explicitly labeled.
2. Compare the downloaded file with its `SHA256SUMS.txt` using
   `shasum -a 256 <downloaded-file>`. Drag **Talent Signal** to Applications.
3. Open the app and enter the HTTPS workspace origin supplied by the workspace
   owner, or paste a full `/workspace/...` link. The app shows the normalized origin.
   Sign in with your own account.

For an owner-operated private workspace, authorize the second Mac in the same
Tailscale network and connect Tailscale before opening the app. The package
contains no private server address, authentication state, or embedded account.
It does not deploy a server or make an existing private server publicly accessible.
The network button changes the workspace address. Loading failures remain
visible with retry; the app never bypasses TLS validation.

Preview packages are ad-hoc signed and **not Apple-notarized**. Gatekeeper may
block downloaded previews. Do not disable Gatekeeper or strip quarantine.
Ordinary external distribution requires a signed, notarized release. For a
preview you have independently verified and trust, Apple provides a per-app
**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway** decision after the first
blocked launch. The device owner must make that decision themselves; the app
never changes security settings. See [Apple’s opening guidance](https://support.apple.com/102445).
Building from the tagged source is another option for preview evaluation.

## Update and rollback

Signed builds use Sparkle 2.10.0. A scheduled check shows a compact update button
beside the account avatar; clicking it opens native version review. The application
menu also offers **Check for Updates**, including when the Web server is unavailable
or still runs an older Web version. Download and restart require a user decision;
automatic download/installation is disabled. **Settings → Updates** controls
scheduled checks and opt-in preview releases. Production feeds contain only signed,
notarized packages, including packages in the optional preview channel.

Older pre-Sparkle builds need one manual installation. Unsigned preview builds show
that signed updating is not configured and retain the release-download link. Keep
the previous package for operator rollback; do not lower the feed's build number.
Hosted workspace changes remain independent of the desktop binary.

## Connection and diagnostics

**Settings (⌘ ,) → Connection**, the native toolbar and the Web account menu open
the same native controls. Enter an HTTPS origin or a `/workspace/...` link without
credentials, query parameters or fragments. Test the draft before saving; a stale
probe never applies to a changed address. A successful HEAD request to `/login`
proves HTTP reachability only, not login or API/database health.

Development controls allow HTTP only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, and
optionally enable WebKit inspection. There is no certificate bypass or editable
update-feed URL. Workspace API/provider configuration remains server-owned; the
client does not offer a misleading direct API override for server-rendered pages.
Cookie stores are partitioned by canonical scheme/host/port, including local ports.
The first upgrade from legacy default WebKit storage therefore requires a fresh
login. Switching services asks the user to finish input/uploads before reloading.
Copyable diagnostics omit origins, accounts, cookies and conversation content.

## Automated publication

`.github/workflows/release-macos.yml` runs after successful trusted `main` CI.
It compares macOS source, approved icon, packaging, and release policy with the
last macOS tag and skips unrelated changes. It builds and tests the native app
at the exact verified revision before publishing a unique `macos-<run>-<attempt>`
release, Universal DMG/ZIP, and SHA-256 manifest. Preview releases never become
GitHub's general latest release (which is also used by iOS).

Default mode is `preview`. Set repository variable `MACOS_RELEASE_MODE=signed`
only after provisioning Developer ID signing and notarization. Signed mode
fails closed on missing credentials, signing, notarization, staple validation,
or Gatekeeper assessment. It never falls back to a preview silently.
Manual dispatch accepts only the current default branch and requires successful
push CI for that exact revision.

## Signing configuration

Infisical remains the canonical secret store. Configure a separate GitHub OIDC
identity restricted to this repository's `macos-release` environment, audience
`infisical://talent-signal/macos-release`, and `staging:/release` read scope.
Set `INFISICAL_MACOS_IDENTITY_ID` as a repository variable. Restrict the GitHub
`macos-release` environment to the default branch.

The scoped release environment needs:

- `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`: Developer ID Application certificate with its private key;
- `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: export password;
- `MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY`: exact `Developer ID Application: ...` identity;
- `MACOS_SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY`: base64 Ed25519 public key (32 decoded bytes);
- `MACOS_SPARKLE_PRIVATE_KEY`: corresponding Sparkle Ed25519 seed, used via stdin only;
- `MACOS_NOTARY_KEY_ID`, `MACOS_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`, `MACOS_NOTARY_PRIVATE_KEY`:
  App Store Connect team API key authorized for notarization.

Generate the Sparkle key once using upstream `generate_keys`, retain the private
key in Infisical, and use the corresponding public key in every signed app. Do not
use a rehearsal key. Set optional repository variable `MACOS_UPDATE_CHANNEL` to
`preview` for signed prereleases; it defaults to `stable`. Each new workflow run
has a monotonically increasing build number; retries must not republish different
bytes with an already published build number.

After immutable downloads are published, `publish-appcast.sh` verifies the previous
feed, generates and signs the new feed with pinned upstream tools, validates its
archive URLs/channel/build, and publishes `appcast.xml` on the dedicated
`macos-updates` GitHub release. That release is never GitHub's general latest.
It preserves prior stable entries when adding a preview. Publication ends with a
fresh download and byte comparison. GitHub asset replacement can have a brief
unavailable interval; clients keep their installed app and retry later.

The runner imports credentials into an ephemeral keychain and removes it after
success or failure. Never commit credentials or publish signing inputs with
release artifacts. Apple Development and Apple Distribution identities are not
substitutes for Developer ID Application signing.

## Local verification

Run `dev-storage-guard audit`, then obtain a task-owned directory with
`dev-storage-guard new-artifact macos-distribution`. Pass that path explicitly:

```sh
MACOS_OUTPUT_DIR=/absolute/task-artifact scripts/macos/package.sh
```

The package script verifies both architectures, icon presence, absence of a
bundled private origin, and bundle signature. Preserve requested deliverables
before removing task build products through the storage guard. Native unit tests
run through `scripts/macos/check.sh`; no iOS simulator is needed.

## Isolated update rehearsal

Use `scripts/macos/sparkle-tools.sh` with a task-owned `SPARKLE_TOOLS_DIR` to fetch
and checksum the pinned upstream distribution. With a fresh `MACOS_OUTPUT_DIR`,
run `scripts/macos/rehearse-update.sh`. It creates an isolated Debug application
(`com.talentsignal.macos.rehearsal`), a newer archive and a signed local appcast.
The ephemeral private key stays in that protected output directory, never in the
user Keychain or source. Remove it with the task artifacts after verification.

Run the Web development server on loopback port 4399, then
`python3 scripts/macos/serve-update-rehearsal.py <output>/updates` on port 4398.
Open `<output>/installed/Talent Signal Rehearsal.app`, enable local development,
and connect to `http://127.0.0.1:4399`. The Debug rehearsal opens the real account-footer
components with synthetic content at `/dev/desktop-chrome`; production returns
404 for that page. Verify the quiet indicator, native review, download, signature
check, explicit restart, new installed build and preserved connection. Corrupt a
copy of the served archive to verify rejection and continued use of the old build.
Only Debug rehearsal bundles admit a loopback update feed; production does not.
