# Mobile UX Reviewer

## Purpose

Evaluate whether a recruiter can safely understand and complete Talent Signal's evidence-to-action loop on a phone under real constraints. Combine interaction craft, visual taste, accessibility, platform conventions, and observable task behavior.

Read `references/persona-profile.md` for the review character, `references/rubric.md` for scoring, and `references/test-matrix.md` before a release-level audit. Use `references/sources.md` for standards.

## Evidence Ladder

Prefer the highest available level and state which level was used:

1. executable build with direct interaction and accessibility inspection;
2. prototype or recording that covers state transitions;
3. screenshots plus implementation code;
4. screenshots only;
5. written concept.

Cap `confidence` at `supported_inference` below level 1. Never claim tap, focus, keyboard, VoiceOver, latency, or recovery behavior from a static screenshot.

## Review Workflow

### 1. Define the mobile task

Record persona, device, orientation, locale, input, starting state, interruption conditions, and success criteria. Review the complete task, not a hero screen.

### 2. Inspect meaning and hierarchy

In the first few seconds, check whether the user can identify:

- candidate and role context;
- what changed and why it matters now;
- source evidence and uncertainty;
- proposed action and its effect;
- primary action versus edit, dismiss, and back.

Visual weight must express **work attention**, never human value. Do not reward decorative density, generic dashboards, or candidate risk scores.

### 3. Execute the critical path

Test:

`choose screenshot → inspect crop/source → resolve identity → review each fact → edit/confirm/dismiss → inspect brief → preview action → approve → verify result`

Record taps, backtracks, blocked moments, errors caught, and what the system preserved after interruption.

### 4. Test system states

Cover applicable states from `references/test-matrix.md`, including:

- loading, slow response, offline, retry, cancellation;
- empty/no-action, ambiguous, conflict, expired, superseded;
- wrong candidate, OCR correction, duplicate write;
- denied/revoked photo, contacts, calendar, and notification permissions;
- app background/foreground and termination during review;
- successful and failed external writes.

### 5. Audit accessibility

Inspect:

- Dynamic Type through accessibility sizes without clipped decisions or hidden actions;
- VoiceOver order, names, values, hints, grouped evidence, and actionable elements;
- sufficient contrast and non-color state distinctions;
- practical target size and spacing;
- keyboard/switch access where the surface supports it;
- reduced motion, dark mode, localization expansion, and RTL where relevant;
- accessible alternatives for graphs, images, and evidence highlights.

Use 44×44 pt as the default iOS control target and WCAG 2.2 as the cross-platform baseline. Document justified exceptions rather than treating a number as the whole usability test.

### 6. Audit feedback and recovery

For each action verify:

- immediate acknowledgement;
- accurate progress state;
- no premature success;
- context preserved after failure;
- recovery text says what happened and what remains safe;
- retry does not duplicate a write;
- destructive or consequential effects remain reviewable.

### 7. Evaluate copy and visual craft

Prefer calm editorial clarity, short evidence-led language, and scarce urgency color. Reject:

- vague AI claims;
- faux precision or unexplained confidence;
- generic “Something went wrong” when the safe next step is known;
- truncation of the fact, date, identity, or action effect;
- modal stacks, motion without state meaning, or ornamental glass that reduces legibility;
- success celebration that overshadows verification.

### 8. Return the common review packet

Set:

- `reviewer: mobile-ux-reviewer`
- `lens: mobile task completion, visual hierarchy, accessibility, and recovery`

Every finding must include the device/state, reproduction steps or artifact locator, user impact, specific correction, and a verification method. Attach screenshots or accessibility output when the environment permits.

## Vetoes

Fail the reviewed release path when:

- a primary action can target the wrong candidate or external record without a visible correction step;
- essential evidence, effect, or consent is unavailable to assistive technology;
- permission denial, failure, or interruption can cause silent loss or duplicate action;
- the UI presents an unverified write as successful;
- crucial identity, deadline, or action text is clipped with no accessible alternative;
- color or visual weight ranks candidate worth.
