# Notion capture design review

## Outcome and boundary

Review the user-linked Capture / Inbox / Identity Review concept against the
current product, capture-to-action, and design-system contracts. Produce
traceable prioritized findings and a concrete flow recommendation. This is
a written-concept review, not release approval or implementation work.

## Evidence and unknowns

- Notion page ID: 3d1a444a6c00817ea24be5c5aa945afb.
- Connector reports last edited: 2026-09-04T10:07:01.133Z.
- Full page text retrieved in this run; no screen images or prototype are
  embedded in the returned content.
- In-app browser creation and tab selection each timed out. No screenshot
  was accepted; visual and runtime verification remain unavailable.
- Existing unrelated worktree changes are preserved.
- Source record: [Notion concept](../_index/sources/2026-09-05-notion-capture-design.md).

## Approach

Use sequential recruiter-workflow, evidence-safety, and mobile-UX lenses on
the same written concept. This is a single-agent review, without independent
reviewer consensus. Store each packet before synthesis. Distinguish observed
specification ambiguity from hypothetical implementation failure.

## Milestones

1. Complete: retrieve the source and relevant canonical constraints.
2. Complete: record three lens packets and synthesize the prioritized review.
3. Complete: validate packet contracts and documentation; hand off limitations.

## Completion evidence

A local report and validated panel JSON identify source sections, impacts,
corrections, and acceptance tests. No change to Notion or product behavior
is required. Do not infer demo behavior from the page's runtime claims.

## Result

- [Report](../docs/evaluations/2026-09-05-notion-capture-design/report.md)
  recommends continuing with changes to decision grouping, partial-confirmation
  dependencies, and retention/resumption semantics.
- Panel JSON contract validation passed.
- `pnpm docs:check` passed documentation, wiki, and architecture checks.
- Product and Notion content were not modified. Visual/runtime approval remains
  out of scope because the supplied evidence is a written concept.
