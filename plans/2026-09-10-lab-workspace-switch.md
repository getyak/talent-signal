# Lab workspace switching and navigation recovery

## Outcome and boundary

Enter and leave an isolated test workspace in-app, with verified identity,
visible feedback, preserved original data and reachable navigation. No process
termination, production backend mutation, or TestFlight release is in scope.

## Evidence

- User screenshot: large red workspace banner; primary navigation is absent.
- Code: protected session adoption already increments contextGeneration and
  rebuilds scoped UI. Banner failures are only visible inside the manager.
- Code: retry/reconcile dispatch a returning child to inspectChild, which resets
  its phase to childActive and discards the return direction.
- Reference: [Stripe sandboxes](https://docs.stripe.com/sandboxes/dashboard/manage)
  keeps navigation available under a persistent environment marker and separates
  opening from deletion; [Slack switching](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500002200741-Switch-between-workspaces)
  changes workspace in place on mobile.

## Approach

Preserve the durable return direction on retry, foreground and relaunch. Reserve
physical layout space for the banner above the navigation container. Use a
quiet compact marker, accessible controls, progress and inline-action errors.
Keep return separate from destructive cleanup; verify identity before rebuilding.
Do not force quit or weaken maintenance/credential checks.

## Milestones

1. Complete: regression tests cover offline return via retry/reconcile/relaunch,
   blocked deletion, unchanged owner content and in-process view generation.
2. Complete: return routing, separate banner layout, progress/error recovery,
   explicit manager dismissal and enter/return/reenter UI coverage.
3. Complete: Release build, 10 unit tests and one native backend-backed UI
   journey passed with zero failures or skips. Screenshot inspection,
   localization and docs checks passed.

## Completion evidence

- Native command: `IOS_ONLY_TESTING=TalentSignalTests/LabWorkspaceTests,TalentSignalUITests/LabWorkspaceUITests bash scripts/ios/check.sh` with owned DerivedData and result-bundle paths.
- [Result summary](../docs/evaluations/2026-09-10-lab-workspace-switch/test-summary.json):
  11 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; iPhone 17 Pro, iOS 26.5 Simulator.
- [Test workspace](../docs/evaluations/2026-09-10-lab-workspace-switch/test-workspace.png)
  and [returned workspace](../docs/evaluations/2026-09-10-lab-workspace-switch/returned-workspace.png)
  were visually inspected at the full viewport. The marker occupies its own row;
  all four navigation destinations are visible, and native hit-target/frame and
  page-selection assertions passed.
- [Native readback](../docs/evaluations/2026-09-10-lab-workspace-switch/native-readback.json)
  and [cleanup receipt](../docs/evaluations/2026-09-10-lab-workspace-switch/deletion-receipt.png)
  confirm zero test rows/sessions after deletion and unchanged original people.
- `pnpm docs:check`, localization checks and `git diff --check` passed.
- No TestFlight release was performed. Real-device accessibility and the
  installed app version are not claimed verified.

## Review findings and bounded follow-ups

Reviewer: mobile-ux-reviewer. Lens: mobile task completion, navigation,
feedback and recovery. Initial evidence: screenshot plus code; confidence is
supported inference until the native run completes.

- P1, interrupted return: returning a child with no network or active recording
  leaves a protected return intent, but retry/foreground previously inspected
  the child and rewrote it as active. Fix preserves direction and stop ID;
  tests verify owner identity, regenerated root and leave-before-delete order.
- P1, feedback: the banner previously hid all failure messages in its manager.
  Show failed return at the tapped surface with retry, and progress while
  verifying return; never announce success while the child remains current.
- P1, navigation: screenshot shows no primary destinations under the large red
  marker. Reserve a sibling layout region above NavigationStack rather than
  relying on nested top insets. Native assertions check frame separation,
  hittability and page changes before returning.
- P2, language: "Canonical workspace" / "权威工作区" in an empty test account
  exposes internal architecture and may suggest that test data is production.
  A later empty-state pass should explain that this is an empty testing space
  and offer one sample-input action without copying real account data.
- P2, recovery: if the retained original credential expires, a direct original
  account sign-in path would be clearer than repeated retry. Existing protected
  reauthentication tests remain part of this run; do not bypass verification.
- P2, environment clarity: expiry and cleanup details already live in the
  manager. Keep them there; a persistent countdown or several global actions
  would compete with relationship navigation.

The environment banner is a bounded usability repair, not a new visual design
system. Real-device Dynamic Type, VoiceOver and the user's installed TestFlight
build remain separate from local Simulator proof.
