# Talent Signal

Build quiet, evidence-first relationship intelligence for independent
recruiters. Optimize for trustworthy momentum, not feature volume or agent
theater.

## Start with context

Read [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) and follow its task-based routing. Do not
front-load the repository or ask the user to repeat context it already owns.

For substantial or uncertain work, use [`PLANS.md`](PLANS.md). Review completed
work through [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md).

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- Treat candidate conversations and screenshots as sensitive, purpose-bound
  evidence.
- Keep evidence, confirmed state, interpretation, action, and observed outcome
  distinct.
- Require a human decision before consequential external writes; generated
  pages, summaries, memories, and proposals carry no execution authority.
- Preserve identity, provenance, time, authorization scope, and reversibility.
- Rank work attention, never a person's worth, personality, protected traits,
  culture fit, or acceptance probability.

## Code Review Rules

- Flag any path that promotes interpretation to confirmed state, ranks a
  person, or triggers an external action without message-level evidence,
  provenance, and explicit human authorization.
- Flag any candidate-data path that broadens collection, retention, model
  exposure, or logging beyond the stated purpose, especially when raw
  conversations or screenshots can escape their authorized boundary.
- Flag state transitions, retries, merges, or deletion flows that can lose
  identity, time, idempotency, reversibility, or the evidence required to audit
  the resulting state.

## Work to proof

1. Define one outcome, its boundary, and observable completion evidence.
2. Inspect existing state, expose important unknowns, and preserve unrelated
   user changes.
3. Deliver the smallest complete slice that can test the direction.
4. Verify the state that matters from the real surface; an edit, build, model
   response, or connector call is not proof by itself.
5. Re-plan when evidence invalidates the approach, then route durable learning
   before handoff.

Prefer the narrowest relevant checks. For documentation changes, also run
`pnpm docs:check`. Test ambiguity, no-action, failure, stale state, retry,
recovery, and deletion when they are relevant to the outcome.

## Keep knowledge lean

- Keep canonical repository documentation in English.
- Maintain one authoritative home per claim. Put stable judgment in canonical
  docs, rationale in an ADR, reusable method in `.agents/skills/`, active state
  in a plan, and deterministic behavior in code or tests.
- Capture new human or LLM-authored articles in `_index/`; never hand-edit a
  `wiki-generated` page.
- Use `$project-knowledge-steward` after a repeated or consequential correction
  to encode the narrowest durable prevention and remove superseded guidance.

Follow [`docs/documentation.md`](docs/documentation.md). Do not expand this
always-on file for one ambiguous incident.

## Isolate concurrent work

- Keep resumable progress in plans and inspectable artifacts, not only in chat.
- Isolate independent write work with worktrees or non-overlapping ownership.
- Keep one owner for each source or external state and one owner for synthesis
  and final verification.
- More time or agents does not broaden authorization, evidence access, or the
  definition of done.
